            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

<pb n="9" facs="tcp:56241:7"/> other mens Possessions, &amp;c. These cases do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern any peaceable Religious Exercise, but are of another nature.

               </p>
               <p>If it be objected, <hi>That every Offence against the Law of the Land is a Breach of the publick Peace, or a Violation of the King's Peace. But the</hi> Quakers <hi>Mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings are against the Law,</hi> Ergo <hi>they are a Breach of the King's Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We must deny the major or first Proposition of this Argument. There are divers Offences against Law, which are of another species or kind than Riots, or the breach of the publick Peace, otherwise Writs, Processes and Warrants might be served on the Lord's Day in all other cases, wherein persons are Arrestable, besides those of <hi>Treason, Fellony</hi> or <hi>breach of the Peace;</hi> and then, what needed any such exception to be made by Act of Parliament? as in that of 29 <hi>Car.</hi> 2. <hi>For the better Observation of the Lord's day,</hi> where 'tis expresly said; <hi>That no Writ, Process, Warrant, Order, Judgment or Decree shall be served on that day, Except in cases of Treason, Fellony or breach of the Peace:</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:56241:8"/>
'tis plainly implyed, That there are cases wherein Writs, Processes, Warrants, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are to be served on other days, but not on the <hi>Lords-day,</hi> which are not the Cases of Treason, Fellony or breach of the Peace; and therefore that those particular Cases and Crimes of Treason, Fellony, and Breach of the Peace, do not include all Offences against Law. For any to expound or extend the words of the said Act thus, viz. <hi>That no Warrant shall be served or executed on the</hi> Lord's-day, <hi>except in such cases where some Offence is done against Law;</hi> this were to suppose they might on other dayes serve and execute Writs, Processes, Warrants, &amp;c. (and so daily trouble their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours) for no Offence against Law; which were an absurd Inferrence, the said Act expresly prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the serving or executing Process, Warrant, Order, Judgment or Decree on the Lords-day, for all Matters or Offences, except in cases of Treason, Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony or Breach of the Peace.</p>
               <p>Now in the case of <hi>Breach of the Peace,</hi> there must be a real and actual Breach or Violation of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, as well as of Treason or Fellony, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise the Arrest is against the Statute before quoted, <q rend="margQuotes">as where there are <hi>Riots, Routs</hi> or <hi>Æ²nlawful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies</hi> against the Peace, the Justices of Peace, or two of them at least, together with the the Sheriff or under-Sheriff, may by the Power of the County suppress them, Arrest the Offendors, and record <hi>That <hi>which they have found so done against the Law,</hi>

                  <hi>Note,</hi> There must be matter of Fact found done, that is of a Riotous Nature, in disturbance of the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Peace, and so to be recorded; otherwise, if a Justice, Sheriff, or other Officers, should see a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of persons met peaceably together, and neither saying nor doing the least Evil, perhaps doing no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, but sitting or standing together in silence; What Record or Conviction can they make hereof? What did they see done? If they record nothing but Truth, it must be, <hi>That they heard them not say, nor saw them do any thing;</hi> and therefore no Violence, Force or Injury to any person: Where is then the <hi>Riot</hi> or <hi>Breach</hi> of the <hi>publick Peace?</hi> Seeing that Assemblies <q rend="margQuotes">for <hi>divers Disports</hi> are excused in Law, as being usually not with any intent to offer or do Violence or Hurt to the Person, Possessions or Goods of any other; neither are they (saith <hi>Dalton) Malum in se;</hi> they are (saith he) in themselves neither Evil nor Unlawful; <hi>Dalt.</hi> Tit. <hi>Riots.</hi>

               <p>There is no more Consistency between punishing

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> Its evident then that the Meeting is no <hi>Riot</hi> (being in no Riotous posture) before such mandatory Proclamation; and its as evident, that 'tis a Prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterous and Irregular way of proceeding (and as weakly argued) to make such Proclamation an
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:56241:15"/> occasion or cause of the Riot, when-as a Riot should be the occasion of such Proclamation, for the Riotous Persons or Disturbers of the Peace to disperse, otherwise the Sheriff, &amp;c. may at their wills and pleasures exercise such Jurisdiction and arbitrary Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over any of the King's peaceable Subjects, when they give no occasion for any such command over their persons: This is a new course of preposterous proceeding; and their forcing the Persons to Goal without Warrant, appears as unwarrantable.</p>
               <p>Pray, <hi>first,</hi> by what Law is such Proclamation made by the Sherriff, &amp;c. to Persons in no unquiet, no formidable nor Riotous posture? <hi>secondly,</hi> By what Law do they deem the Meeters not presently submitting to the Sherriffs command, a breach of the Peace or Riot, when they are peaceable and passive, and neither hurt nor offer the least Violence or Harm to any Body? How can it be proved then, that any thing is done by them that is <hi>Malum in se,</hi> to occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion such command or penalty?</p>
               <p>For where the Law requires the Justice of Peace, together with the Sherriff, to command the dispersing of such Unlawful Assemblies as are Riotous in Intention or Fact, they are really so first. And their being such either by Intention manifest, by shew of Armour or menacing Words, &amp;c. or else Riotous in Fact (their being Riotous) is the occasion of the Justices manda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Proclamation to disperse; and not his Procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation the cause of their being such. Nor can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting Justice be justly pleaded for such Proclamation and Punishment for <hi>breach of the King's Peace,</hi> when no matter of Fact appears of that nature, on their
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:56241:16"/> parts, who are thus prosecuted and punished for <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention;</hi> and the pretence of Prevention grants no Fact perpetrated or done. And Suspicion cannot justly be pretended to punish persons equally with Offendors, any more than to Hang a man on Suspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion of Fellony, when no such fact can be proved against him.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Answ.</hi> No; 'tis wholly unwarrantable, and against Law, as by the following Reasons, Authorities and Instances plainly appears.</p>
               <p>By common Law we find,<note place="margin">

But if any of them be forced to end their days in Prison, 'tis to be hoped, That the <hi>Coroners Inquest</hi> will have good Information, and take just cognizance of the occasion, that the Cry of innocent Blood may not be unjustly smothered, when they are unjustly and clandestinly destroyed in a nasty Goal.</note> by the common Law.
